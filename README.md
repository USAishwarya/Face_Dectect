## Project overview
This repository contains a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based face detection pipeline with tools for:
- data preprocessing & augmentation  
- model training and checkpointing  
- evaluation (Precision / Recall / mAP)  
- inference (webcam, single image, batch folder)  
- saving cropped faces for downstream tasks

The project is designed to be easy to reproduce and extend for research or small production demos.

## Features
- CNN-based detector (trainable on custom datasets)  
- Real-time webcam inference with bounding boxes  
- Batch image processing and annotated-output saving  
- Option to save cropped face images for dataset expansion  
- Training logs, model checkpointing, and evaluation scripts
